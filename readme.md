### Observations 
1. Hosting Methodology seen on AWS only one website which is not related to msFit-sa , No instances running currently on Ohio , but it is totally insurced and no priviliges that protecting the project Assests ..

2. The whole videos are rendered from youtube which is publicly accessable 

3. The web is not secured by SSL connection inspected on IOS and expecting the same on Android .. 

4. the s3 bucket is directly accessable through internet "different site !!!!!!! "

5. payment is not secured with SSL , it depends on Apple Pay APIs 

6. a lot of UI glitches ..

7. it seems that the app hosted somewhere else than AWS in the moment of inspection 25-06-2021 

8. Recommended to host on Vemo or Secure the youtube public links
